## 5. Match Yellow Cross With The Other Layers 

## 6. Match the Three Colors Of Corners On The Third Layer
**Correct Corner**: Three colors of the corner align with the three faces. They don't need to align perfectly -- as long as the name of the colors match. For example, yellow, blue and red. This corner stay at the intersection of the yellow/blue/red center side. 

If there are 1 correct corner: put it at the upper right of the cube. If there are 0 correct corner: start from anywhere.
