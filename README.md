# Steps to Solve A Cube

## 0.Right Hand 4 Moves and Left Hand 4 Moves

Right hand 4 moves:
* right side up
* up side clockwise
* right side down
* up side counter clockwise

Left hand 4 moves:
* left side up
* up site counter clockwise
* left side down
* up side clockwise


## 1. White Cross on First Layer
## 2. White Corners on First Layer
## 3. Second Layer: Upper Edge to Second Layer Side Edge

## 4. Yellow Cross on Third Layer
The target is to create a yellow cross on the top layer. If you have it, skip this step.
If you notice an "L"shape containing the center yellow piece and two other pieces, turn the top layer so the "L" shape stays at the upper right corner.

* front side clockwise
* Right hand 4 moves
* front side counter clockwise
* You may see a horizontal yellow line. Keep iterating until there is a yellow cross.


## 5. Match Yellow Cross With The Other Layers 
**Matched cross cells**: the other block of the yellow cross matches with the center color. For example, an edge block in the cross with yellow and red should match the red center color.

If you have 4 matched cross cells, skip this step.

If you only have two matched cross cells, put the two matched cells at the back and right side, then:

* right side up
* top side clockwise, pay attention to "the pair" of the same color
* right side down
* top side clockwise
* right side up
* put "the pair" back with the right center color
* Adjust the cube so the yellow cross has 4 matched colors on 4 sides

## 6. Match the Three Colors Of Corners On The Third Layer
**Correct Corner**: Three colors of the corner align with the three faces. They don't need to align perfectly -- as long as the name of the colors match. For example, yellow, blue and red. This corner stay at the intersection of the yellow/blue/red center side. 

If there are 1 correct corner: put it at the upper right of the cube. If there are 0 correct corner: start from anywhere.

**Repeat until there are 4 Correct Corner**
* top clockwise
* right side up
* top counter clockwise
* left side up

* top clockwise
* right side down
* top counter clockwise
* left side down



## 7. Solve The Cube One Corner After The Other
* Turn the cube upside down so the white layer is on top
* Solve the yellow corner
* Turn the lower layer counter clockwise and solve the next yellow corner
* It might look "wrong" but keep working
